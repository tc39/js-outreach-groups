# JS outreach groups

Some TC39 delegates are organizing meetings with various stakeholders in order to get more input in the process and share information with the community. Current calls include:
- Educators
- Frameworks
- Tools and transpilers

Planned future calls include:
- Open-to-everyone community call
- Academia
- Collaboration with the [Node open standards team](https://github.com/nodejs/open-standards)

This repository is used to archive meeting minutes.

If you would like a calendar invitation to one of these calls, please get in touch by filing an issue on this repository or writing an email to littledan@igalia.com 

The role of these calls within TC39 process:
- Input on direction/priorities
- Feedback on Stage 2 or earlier proposals
- Distribute information about TC39, Stage 3+ proposals, etc
- Expose opportunities to get involved (in GitHub, docs, etc)
- Not a consensus-seeking group, just a data source
